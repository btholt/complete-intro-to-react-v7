If you&#39;re migrating from a class component to a hooks-using function component, this can be helpful too because <code>useLayout</code> runs at the same time as <code>componentDidMount</code> and <code>componentDidUpdate</code> whereas <code>useEffect</code> is scheduled after. This should be a temporary fix.</p>\n<p>The only time you <em>should</em> be using <code>useLayoutEffect</code> is to measure DOM nodes for things like animations. In the example, I measure the textarea after every time you click on it (the onClick is to force a re-render.) This means you&#39;re running render twice but it&#39;s also necessary to be able to capture the correct measurments.</p>\n","slug":"uselayouteffect","title":"useLayoutEffect","section":"Hooks in Depth","icon":"search","filePath":"/home/runner/work/complete-intro-to-react-v7/complete-intro-to-react-v7/lessons/09-hooks-in-depth/H-uselayouteffect.md","nextSlug":"/complete-intro-to-react-v7/lessons/hooks-in-depth/useimperativehandle","prevSlug":"/complete-intro-to-react-v7/lessons/hooks-in-depth/usecallback"}},"__N_SSG":true}
