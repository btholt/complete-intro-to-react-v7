Via a package called browserslist (which Parcel installed for you) you can Babel what browsers to target.</p>\n<p>Head to <a href=\"https://browserslist.dev\">browserslist.dev</a>.</p>\n<p>Here you can see what sorts of queries you can provide to browsers and which browsers those will provide. By default Parcel uses <code>&gt; .25%</code> which targets all browsers that have more than .25% usage. When I ran as of writing this, this would cover 92% of all Internet users. That&#39;s a pretty okay range to target depending on who your audience is. If you&#39;re targeting old government computers this won&#39;t work but if you&#39;re Airbnb and targeting mostly modern browsers you&#39;re probably okay.</p>\n<p>Since we&#39;re targeting ourselves and this is just a dev project, let&#39;s just target ourselves. Put <code>last 2 Chrome versions</code>, <code>last 2 Firefox versions</code>, <code>last 2 Edge versions</code>, <code>last 2 Safari versions</code>, or whatever you want. For the course notes I&#39;ll put <code>last 2 Chrome versions</code> since I&#39;ve observed many of my students use Chrome.</p>\n<p>In your package.json, add a new top level field called <code>browserslist</code> (notice the <code>s</code>, browser<strong>s</strong>list):</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-json\"><span class=\"hljs-punctuation\">{</span>\n  …\n  <span class=\"hljs-attr\">&quot;browserslist&quot;</span><span class=\"hljs-punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"hljs-punctuation\">[</span>\n    <span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;last 2 Chrome versions&quot;</span>\n  <span class=\"hljs-punctuation\">]</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-punctuation\">}</span>\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>🏁 <a href=\"https://github.com/btholt/citr-v7-project/tree/master/02-js-tools\">Click here to see the state of the project up until now: 02-js-tools</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n","slug":"browserslist","title":"Browserslist","section":"JS Tools","icon":"hammer","filePath":"/home/runner/work/complete-intro-to-react-v7/complete-intro-to-react-v7/lessons/03-js-tools/F-browserslist.md","nextSlug":"/complete-intro-to-react-v7/lessons/core-react-concepts/jsx","prevSlug":"/complete-intro-to-react-v7/lessons/js-tools/parcel"}},"__N_SSG":true}
